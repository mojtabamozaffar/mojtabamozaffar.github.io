**Introduction**
Simulation has long been a cornerstone of both computational physics and robotics, enabling researchers and engineers to model complex systems, predict their behavior, and optimize designs before committing to costly real-world experiments. Traditional simulations, however, often treat the simulation process as a black box when it comes to optimizing system parameters, relying on gradient-free methods that can struggle with high-dimensional design spaces. Differentiable simulation closes this gap by making simulation outputs differentiable with respect to their inputs, unlocking the use of powerful gradient-based optimization and learning algorithms.

**What Is Differentiable Simulation?**
At its core, differentiable simulation embeds the entire simulation pipeline—governed by partial differential equations, contact dynamics, or other physics-based models—into an automatic differentiation (AD) framework. This approach tracks all mathematical operations to construct a computational graph, which allows gradients of any scalar loss function to be propagated back to input parameters via backpropagation. In contrast to numerical or symbolic differentiation, AD provides exact derivatives up to machine precision and scales efficiently even for high-dimensional parameter spaces 
.


**Applications in Computational Physics**
Additive Manufacturing Process Design
A compelling demonstration of differentiable simulation in computational physics is in additive manufacturing (AM), where the goal is to optimize time-series process parameters—such as laser power—to achieve desired thermal histories or material properties. By integrating a finite element method (FEM) thermal solver into an AD framework, one can parameterize laser power as a function of time using a small neural network. The network outputs feed directly into the differentiable simulation, which computes temperature evolution and, ultimately, a loss based on deviations from target thermal metrics.

For example, Mozaffar et al. developed a differentiable FEM model to design laser power profiles that optimize both the full thermal history and specific heat treatment durations for Inconel 718 parts. In one case study, they reconstructed a hidden random laser power pattern by minimizing the mean-squared error between simulated and target temperature profiles, achieving convergence within a few hundred gradient steps despite the high dimensionality (∼26,000 time steps) 
. In another study, they introduced a smooth approximation of heat-treatment time—formulated via sigmoid functions centered on temperature bounds—to create a well-behaved loss landscape for gradient descent, greatly improving optimization robustness and experimental transferability 
.

**Materials and Beyond**
Beyond process parameters, differentiable simulation can inform material design (e.g., tailoring microstructure evolution under heat treatment) and system identification by fitting physical model parameters directly against experimental data, all within the same unified computational graph.

**Applications in Robotics**
Differentiable simulation has rapidly found traction in robotics, where it enables end-to-end learning and optimization for control, planning, and system identification:

+ Contact-rich manipulation: By implementing differentiable solvers for rigid-body dynamics with frictional contact, researchers have used gradient-based trajectory optimization (e.g., iLQR) to learn control policies that respect complex contact interactions 
.

+ Soft robotics: Frameworks like ChainQueen leverage differentiable continuum mechanics to optimize actuator inputs in real time, enabling model-based reinforcement learning for soft robots with deformable bodies 
.

+ Railless locomotion and multi-phase systems: Differentiable simulation of multiphase materials (e.g., cloth, fluids) informs robotic manipulation tasks involving deformables, soft grippers, or flexible environments 
.

+ Neural augmentation: Hybrid models combine physics-based differentiable solvers with neural networks to capture unmodeled dynamics, providing accurate yet interpretable models for control and estimation 
.

**Future Directions**
+ Dynamic geometry and toolpath differentiation: Extending differentiable simulation to handle mesh generation, topology changes, and real-time geometry adaptation remains a significant challenge for AM and robotics alike.

+ Multi-objective and multi-physics optimization: Integrating multiple differentiable estimators—for thermal, mechanical, and stability metrics—will enable holistic, multi-objective design in complex engineering systems.

+ Scalability and solver innovations: Improving memory efficiency and solver speed for large-scale AD (e.g., sparse linear algebra, domain decomposition) will broaden the applicability to industrial-scale problems.

**Conclusion**
Differentiable simulation bridges the gap between high-fidelity physics models and modern gradient-based optimization and learning methods. From designing bespoke additive manufacturing processes to crafting advanced robotic controllers in contact-rich, deformable environments, it offers a unified framework for end-to-end optimization. As AD frameworks and solver technologies continue to mature, differentiable simulation is poised to revolutionize how we design, control, and understand complex physical systems.
