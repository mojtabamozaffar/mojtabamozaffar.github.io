summary: "I designed, built, and programmed a hexapod legged robot from the ground up. The robot features fully custom mechanical and electrical systems, supports multiple gait behaviors, and connects wirelessly to a smartphone for real-time control. This post explores the design process, locomotion capabilities, and key engineering choices."

As a personal robotics challenge, I undertook the design and implementation of a **hexapod robot**—a six-legged walking machine with smooth, omnidirectional motion and responsive control via a mobile device. This end-to-end project covered CAD modeling and 3D printing, custom PCB design, embedded programming, and mobile communication. 

### 1. **Mechanical and Electrical Design**
The mechanical design is heavily inspired by [this repo](https://github.com/MakeYourPet/hexapod). The robot features a fully 3D-printed frame with articulated joints, each actuated by commodity servos. Its structure balances strength and weight, allowing for stable movement across different gaits.

The electronics include a Servo2040 for controlling the servos, power modules, and a bluetooth module for remote control.

### 2. **Gait Implementation and Locomotion**
The hexapod supports multiple gaits and actions including:

- **Standing and Sitting**: Smooth vertical transitions with coordinated joint movement
- **Omnidirectional Walking**: Move in any direction using tripod gait and variations
- **Turning in Place**: Rotate without displacement using synchronized limb adjustments
- **Tilting and Height Control**: Adapt body posture by dynamically changing leg positions

The gait planner uses inverse kinematics to calculate precise servo positions in real time, allowing the robot to smoothly navigate its environment.

### 3. **Mobile App Integration**
To make control intuitive, I built a companion app that connects to the robot via Bluetooth. Users can select gait modes, steer the robot, and adjust its posture—all through a simple interface on their smartphone.

This mobile interface abstracts complex control logic behind easy-to-use commands, opening the robot up to users with no robotics background.

### 4. **Engineering Takeaways**
Building this hexapod from scratch gave me hands-on experience with:

- **Multi-legged locomotion and stability**
- **Embedded systems integration**
- **Wireless communication and latency handling**
- **Mechanical trade-offs in 3D-printed designs**

The result is a robot that not only demonstrates complex motion but also acts as a platform for further experimentation in adaptive gaits, obstacle navigation, and even reinforcement learning-based control.
